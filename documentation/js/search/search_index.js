Catalog\nEste projeto foi desenvolvido em Angular seguindo práticas modernas de componentização e separação de responsabilidades. Os modelos de dados foram organizados na pasta models/ e os mapas de cores e constantes em constants/ para manter a estrutura limpa e escalável. As chamadas HTTP usam Observable com forkJoin para otimizar múltiplas requisições paralelas. Os dados de favoritos são persistidos via CookieService, centralizando a lógica de leitura e gravação em um único ponto. O código evita duplicidade com funções auxiliares como isFavorite() para controle de estado visual. Eventos de clique usam stopPropagation() para evitar conflitos com navegação via routerLink. O estilo de codificação prioriza legibilidade, responsabilidade única por método e uso de tipagem forte com interfaces TypeScript. A interface responsiva foi pensada com CSS puro para modais, evitando dependência de bibliotecas externas. O sistema de paginação foi criado para lidar com grandes volumes de dados mantendo desempenho e experiência fluida. Todo o projeto segue padrões de clean code, com foco em manutenção e expansibilidade futura.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules - modules","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n    Modules\n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview - overview","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n    Overview\n\n    \n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    4 Components\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    3 Injectables\n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    15 Interfaces\n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"properties.html":{"url":"properties.html","title":"package-properties - properties","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        Properties\n    \n    \n        \n            Version : 0.0.0\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"miscellaneous/variables.html":{"url":"miscellaneous/variables.html","title":"miscellaneous-variables - variables","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Miscellaneous\n  Variables\n\n\n\n    Index\n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            appConfig   (src/.../app.config.ts)\n                        \n                        \n                            pokemonColorMap   (src/.../pokemonColors.ts)\n                        \n                        \n                            pokemonTypeColorMap   (src/.../pokemonColors.ts)\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n    src/app/app.config.ts\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        appConfig\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Type :     ApplicationConfig\n\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Default value : {\n  providers: [\n    provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true }),\n    provideRouter(routes),\n    provideHttpClient()\n]\n}\n                    \n                \n\n\n        \n    \n\n    src/app/constants/pokemonColors.ts\n    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        pokemonColorMap\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Type :     Record\n\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Default value : {\n  black: '#7d7d7d',\n  blue: '#a5c8ff',\n  brown: '#d2b48c',\n  gray: '#d3d3d3',\n  green: '#b2e2b2',\n  pink: '#ffc1cc',\n  purple: '#d1b3ff',\n  red: '#E34234',\n  white: '#ededed',\n  yellow: '#fff5b3',\n}\n                    \n                \n\n\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        pokemonTypeColorMap\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Type :     Record\n\n                    \n                \n                \n                    \n                        Default value : {\n    normal: '#d3d3c7',\n    fire: '#ffb482',\n    water: '#a4d8ff',\n    electric: '#ffe37b',\n    grass: '#b2e8b2',\n    ice: '#d4f1f9',\n    fighting: '#e79a9a',\n    poison: '#d4a0d4',\n    ground: '#f2e1b1',\n    flying: '#d0c2f0',\n    psychic: '#ffb3c6',\n    bug: '#d3e882',\n    rock: '#e2d3a3',\n    ghost: '#b9a2d0',\n    dragon: '#b090f8',\n    dark: '#a69889',\n    steel: '#d0d0e0',\n    fairy: '#f9c2d1'\n}\n                    \n                \n\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
